                    <header><h2>Don't have book expectations</h2></header>
                    <p>Thrift stores are not book stores or libraries. They likely won’t have multiple copies of titles, won’t have brand new titles (if they do, beware: it is probably not a good book if people are giving it away so soon after buying it), and are not going to have a catalog of the books they have. If you want a specific title- the thrift store is probably not the place for you to shop for books! </p>
                </div>
                <div class= "tip">
                    <header><h2>Be open</h2></header>
                    <p>Most of the books at thrift stores range from 25¢ to $1.50. You can go wild! Buy books that you would not buy full price, try out a new genre, buy that outdated self-help book! There is no pressure to like thrift store books, you can always donate them back if you don’t like them.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <header><h2>Take your time</h2>  </header>
                    <p>Take your time to look over the bookshelves. Often books in thrift stores are just put on the shelves without organization. Book titles blend together when you don’t look carefully. I recommend taking a quick first look at all the bookshelves, and grab whatever titles look interesting. After the first glance, take a second more thorough comb through, take a book break- browse around the rest of the thrift store- then come back for a third comb through. There are gems hidden on the shelves if you look hard enough!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <header><h2>Invest Wisely</h2></header>
                <p>Though you can find some great books at thrift stores, the majority are mediocre, and some are just flat out bad. It is important to expand the genres you read, but it is also important to know when you just are not interested in a book. Save your 50¢, bookshelf space, and time- don’t buy books that you know you will never read!</p>
