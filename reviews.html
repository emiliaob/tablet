                <h2>Love and Gelato<br>Jenna Evans Welch</h2>
                <p>Though this book is geared towards young adults it was an enjoyable read. Evans Welch's writing transports readers into Tuscany and into an adorable love story. This is a coming of age story with real-life complexities and life issues. Worth the read. </p>

                <h2> On the Corner of Bitter and Sweet
                    <br>
                    Jamie Ford
                </h2>
                <p>This book is truly bitter and sweet. I loved the time jumps between WWII and 1980's and the perspective they gave. This book was enjoyable and informative- as it showed various perspectives on Japanese internment during WWII all while portraying a fated love story. </p>

                    Cathleen Schine
                </h2>
                <p>This book offers a perspective of 1960's America and the changes in culture that were occuring.  However, the characters were either overly positive or amazingly negative. The extreme positive and negatives left little room for character development deeper than surface level. Despite character issues, this book was an interesting read.</p>

                    The Picture of Dorian Gray
                    <br>
                    Oscar Wilde
                </h2>
                <p>This is a classic for a reason.  Wilde's description of Dorian Gray, a character willing to disregard any moral standard to be beautiful and popular, is very relevant today. This book is sometimes very dense, but overall is a thrilling read.</p>

                    Ayn Rand
                </h2>
                <p>Ayn Rand provides a scathing review of society in this 1400 page book. Her depiction of a failing American society is scary, and very much parralells many current events and social issues. Depite this books' relevance, at times it is very difficult to read and very wordy.</p>

                    Alenda Dillion
                </h2>
                <p>This book offers relevant criticism of the Catholic Church and many of the issues within its structure. Despite the relevant criticism, this books lacks nuance and character development- skimming over complicated issues and internal dilemmas without much explanation. </p>

                    Michelle Richmond
                </h2>
                <p>I got what I paid for in this (25¢) book. I am typically generous with my ratings, but I could not stand any of the characters in this book. I cannot think of a redemable quality in this book.</p>

                    Apricot Irving
                </h2>
                <p>This is the real life story of Barbara Kingsolver's "Posionwood Bible." Irving's memoir provides insight into the complex role of missionaries in developing countries, and the harm that can be done- both to native familes and the missionaries themselves. </p>

                    <br>
                    Paul Coelho
                </h2>
                <p>A philosopical reflection on life, and the role that we as humans play in the world. A touching and understandable parable about how the things you are looking for the most are sometimes right under your nose (or head for that matter). A must read.</p>

            <div class= "zombies">

                    Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
                    <br>
                    Seth Grahame-Smith and Jane Austen
                </h2>
                <p>A more entertaining take on the classic Austen novel. The introduction of zombies into the English country side allows the women in this story to transform from boring and mostly powerless into being in charge of their own destiny- a welcomed improvement.</p>

            <div class= "machu">

                    <br>
                Mark Adams
                </h2>
                <p>I spent half of this book believeing that is was a fictional story, and the other half wondering how Mark Adams ended up having such an interesting life. This story winds the historical and (somewhat) fictional story of the 'discovery' of Machu Picchu with Adams' discovery of the Inca Trail and himself. A interesting and adventure inspiring read.</p>

                Nina George
                </h2> 
                <p>A story of preventable love and loss, filled with perceptive and ecclectic characters who are very inept at developing relationships. Perfect for the beach, but not particularly though inspiring.</p>
